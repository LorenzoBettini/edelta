The Ecores are not loaded from this directory: they are loaded through classpath in EdeltaVersionMigratorTest.
The Ecores are duplicated here only to easily open the XMI files and possibly create new ones as dynamic instances.

Unfortunately, such Ecores must be kept in sync in this project and in edelta.lib.tests.
